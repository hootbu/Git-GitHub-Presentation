###### Created by Emir Yorgun

## Overview

This project is a dynamic, animated PowerPoint presentation (.pptx) designed to guide users from beginner to advanced proficiency in Git, aiming for a "Zero to Hero" journey. Built using content from the official Git documentation ([git-scm.com/docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)), it covers a wide range of popular Git commands and concepts through engaging visuals and concise explanations.

## Content

The presentation covers the following Git commands and concepts, structured to illustrate the general Git process cycle and advanced workflows:

- **Core Commands:** Git Clone, Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push, Git Pull, Git Fetch, Git Branch, Git Checkout, Git Switch, Git Merge, Git Rebase, Git Reset, Git Diff, Git Reflog, Git Stash, Git Cherry-Pick
- **Key Concepts:** General Git Process Cycle, Pull Requests, Merge Conflicts, Relative References (e.g., the Tilde `~` operator), and the role of `origin/` in remote repositories
- **Comparisons:** Differences between commands like Git Checkout vs. Git Switch, and handling Merge Conflicts

Each topic is presented with animations to enhance understanding, making complex workflows like rebasing or resolving merge conflicts intuitive and engaging.
